-Watching a new show immediately after its release is always a great way to start an AnimeWalker day. This will give you a sense of when the next episode will air and provide you with a recap of the story before you even get started watching.
-If you&rsquo;re looking for something more drawn out, try checking out OVA&rsquo;s or one-shots before getting into the full series. These episodes usually have less action and more atmosphere, which can add to your enjoyment while giving you more closure on the story.</p><h2 id=shiny-wallpapers---wallpaper-cave-7>Shiny Wallpapers - Wallpaper Cave<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#shiny-wallpapers---wallpaper-cave-7>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=http://wallpapercave.com/wp/c87yIA4.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.vPZf8CeqktpyeD92poh39AHaEc&amp;pid=15.1"' alt="Shiny Wallpapers - Wallpaper Cave"><p><em>Source: wallpapercave.com</em></p><blockquote><p>shiny wallpaper wallpapers wallpapercave.</p></blockquote><ol start=3><li>cream cheese</li></ol><h2 id=shiny-wallpapers-55-images-2>Shiny Wallpapers (55+ Images)<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#shiny-wallpapers-55-images-2>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=http://getwallpapers.com/wallpaper/full/8/5/9/1007796-shiny-wallpapers-2560x1600-for-desktop.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.rik59vHfkHRRuJvqs0tTUQHaEo&amp;pid=15.1"' alt="Shiny Wallpapers (55+ images)"><p><em>Source: getwallpapers.com</em></p><blockquote><p>shiny wallpaper wallpapers background gold desktop.</p></blockquote><p>Wallpaper Examples: Some popular wallpapers that are used on a daily basis.
